# Lucid Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** December 2024

## Overview

Lucid ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle data in the Lucid Chrome Extension.

## Data Collection and Storage

### Local Storage Only
Lucid operates entirely locally on your device. **We do not collect, transmit, or store any data on external servers.**

### What Data is Stored Locally

The extension stores the following information locally on your device using Chrome's local storage API:

1. **Site Configuration Data:**
   - Domain names you choose to track (e.g., "instagram.com", "facebook.com")
   - Time limits you set for each site
   - Usage statistics (time spent, scroll counts)
   - Your preferences (grayscale mode, pause state)

2. **Pomodoro Timer Settings:**
   - Focus and rest session durations
   - Current timer state

3. **User Preferences:**
   - Whether tracking is paused
   - Grayscale mode preference

### How We Use This Data

- **Time Tracking:** To monitor your usage of configured websites
- **Limit Enforcement:** To block or remind you when limits are reached
- **Feature Functionality:** To provide the Pomodoro timer and other focus features

## Data Transmission

**We do not transmit any data to external servers.** All data remains on your device and is never sent to us or any third party.

## Permissions Explained

Lucid requests the following Chrome extension permissions:

- **`storage`**: To save your preferences and usage data locally
- **`tabs`**: To detect which websites you're visiting
- **`scripting`**: To inject content scripts that track usage and display blocking screens
- **`notifications`**: To show reminders when you've been browsing for extended periods
- **`host_permissions` (`<all_urls>`)**: To detect and track activity on websites you configure

## Third-Party Services

Lucid does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

## Data Deletion

You can delete all stored data at any time by:
1. Uninstalling the extension (removes all data)
2. Using Chrome's extension storage management tools
3. Resetting individual site configurations through the extension popup

## Children's Privacy

Lucid is not intended for users under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The "Last Updated" date at the top indicates when changes were made. Continued use of the extension after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## Contact
